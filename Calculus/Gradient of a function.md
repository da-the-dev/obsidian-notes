Gradient of a function - a vector that points in a direction of the greatest change. It is also zero at minimum and maximum of a function.

Gradient is a "derivative" of multi-variable functions.
## Example
$F(x, y, z) = x + y^2 + z^3$
$\frac{dF}{dx} = 1$
$\frac{dF}{dy} = 2y$
$\frac{dF}{dz} = 3z^{2}$
Vector:
$\Delta F = \left(\begin{matrix} 1 \\ 2y \\ 3z^2\end{matrix} \right)$
