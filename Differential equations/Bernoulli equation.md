Bernoulli [[Linear first order differential equations|LFO]] differential equation is of type
$$
y'+p(x)y=q(x)y^n;\ n>1
$$
# Solution
1.  $v=\dfrac{1}{y^{n-1}}$
2. Substitute so that the equation depends only on $v$
3. Bring to standard form of LFO.
4. Solve as [[Linear first order differential equations#Case for nonhomogeneous|nonhomogeneous LFO]]
5. Substitute back
