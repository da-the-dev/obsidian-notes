# Solving basic differential equations
The most basic, basically canonical differential equations are of this form
$$
\dfrac{dy}{dx}=f(x)
$$
We can simply put $y$ on the left and $x$ on the right sides of the equation
$$
dy=f(x)dx
$$
Now integrate
$$
\int dy=\int f(x)dx  
$$
Which is basically
$$
y=F(x) + C
$$
If we have some initial value, we can treat the solution as a part of an [[Initial value problem]].
