A differential equation is an equation that relates one or more unknown functions and their derivatives
# Ordinary differential equation
An *ordinary differential equation* is a type of differential equation that is dependent on only a single independent variable ($y$ for example).
# Types of DEs
## Linear
A differential equation is linear if the function terms appear in the first simple power
## Non-linear
A differential equation is linear if the function terms do not appear only in the first simple power. It could be $e^{x}$, $(y'')^{2}$, all kinds of stuff
## Homogeneous
A differential with its right size $f(x)\equiv 0$ is called homogeneous

## Non-homogeneous
A differential with its right size $f(x)\not\equiv 0$ is called non-homogeneous
# Types of solutions
## General
A solution of a differential equation has arbitrary parameters:
$$
y=c_{1}e^{x}+c_{2}e^{2x}
$$
This create a family of solutions
## Particular
A solution of a differential equation that is free of arbitrary parameters
$$
y=5e^{x}+2e^{2x}
$$
## Singular
For non-linear differential equations it is not guaranteed to have a complete solution by obtaining only the general. This type of solution cannot be obtained from the general solution
### Example
Consider:
$$
8'+y^{3}=0
$$
A general solution is:
$$
y=\dfrac{2}{\sqrt{ x+c }},\text{on interval } I=(-c, \infty)
$$
A solution $y=0$ also works. However, we *cannot obtain* such solution by *substituting* an appropriate $c$ into the general solution
