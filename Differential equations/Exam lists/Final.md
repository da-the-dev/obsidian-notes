# Test 1
- Direction fields and trajectories for first-order differential equations.  
- A [[First order differential equations|first order equation]] and the [[Separable variables|method of separable variables]].  
- A linear non-homogeneous equation or [[Bernoulli equation]] and the [[Variation of parameters|method of variations of constant]].  
- ~~An exact equation and a review of AI solutions for the given equation. ~~
- [[Homogeneous first order differential equations]].

# Test 2
- N-dimensional systems of equations with constant coefficients, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors. You may be asked to construct the set of fundamental solutions in matrix form.
- Non-homogeneous two-dimensional systems of first-order equations, mostly involving the method of variable constants.
- Equilibrium points (stationary points) of nonlinear equations or systems of equations, along with the properties of linearized systems in small neighborhoods of these points.
- Conservation laws of nonlinear equations and trajectories in phase space. You will be asked to verify the conservation law and draw families of trajectories for a given equation or system.
