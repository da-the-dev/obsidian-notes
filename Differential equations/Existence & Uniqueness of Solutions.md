NB! Here solutions to [[Differential equations]] are considered at a point, like in [[Slope fields]].
# Cases
1. No solution for this differential equation <u>through this point</u> exists
2. Infinitely many solutions
3. One unique solution in the neighborhood of a point

For
$\dfrac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)$ , $y(a)=b\dots (a,b)$
# Existence
If a function is [[#Note on continuety|continuous]] around the point, a solution exists
# Uniqueness
If $\dfrac{ \partial f(x,y) }{ \partial x }$ is continuous around the existing point, the solution is unique.
# Note on continuity
Function can be continuous even at an endpoint. In this note, "continuous" also means "not an endpoint"
