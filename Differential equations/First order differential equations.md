A first-order [[Differential equations|differential equation]] is an equation that relates an unknown function to its first derivative. It is of the form:
$$
F(x,y,y')=0
$$
where $F$ is a function of three variables $x$, $y$, and $y'=\dfrac{dy}{dx}$
# Solution
Consider
$$
\dfrac{dy}{dx}=f(x)
$$
We can simply put $dy$ on the left and $dx$ on the right side of the equation
$$
\begin{align} \\
dy&=f(x)dx \\
\int dy&=\int f(x)dx  \\
y&=F(x)+C
\end{align}
$$
If we have some initial value, we can treat the solution as a part of an [[Initial value problem]].
