Given a [[Differential equations|differential equation]], a family of solutions (function with $C$), and an initial value, find particular solution for this initial value.
# Steps
- Verify the solution
- Solve the differential equation for $C$ considering the initial value 
- Substitute $C$ into the family of solutions and find a particular solution
