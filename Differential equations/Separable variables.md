[[First order differential equations]] of type:
$$
y'=f(x)g(y)
$$
or
$$
M(x)N(y)dx + P(x)Q(y)dy = 0
$$
can be solved using separable variables.

# Idea
- Bring $y$ and $dy$ on one side, and $x$ and $dx$ on the other 
- Integrate both sides

If the equation is of type
$$
y'=f(ax-by)
$$
are brought to
$$
z=ax+by
$$
This is derivated and then solved as a differential equation.
- After we obtain a general solution around $z$, we reverse the substitution to get a general solution in $x$ and $y$
