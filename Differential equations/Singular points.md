[[Differential equations#Non-linear|Non-linear differential equations]] might have [[Differential equations#Singular|singular solutions]]. Usually, when we talk about singular points, think [[Second order linear differential equations]]. To get a complete solution, we need to find these points first:
# Algorithm
Consider:
$$
\dfrac{ d^{2}y }{ dx^{2} } +P(x)\dfrac{ dy }{ dx } +Q(x)y=0
$$
We need to check whether $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are defined for $R$. If they don't, then the breakpoint is the singular point
