Most of the time we cannot solve the a [[Differential equations|differential equation]]. However, we can approximate.
# Idea
- First derivative represents *slopes*
- So, $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=f(x, y)$ means we have a formula to find slope ($\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ is the slope) at any point by plugging into $f(x,y)$

# Process
- Make a graph with many vectors that represent slopes at points on $XY$
- Given a point (initial condition), we can find an approximation curve, whose slopes f it
