# Entailment
Entailment is a relationship between two [[Sentence|sentences]] where the truth of one sentence requires the truth of another sentence:
$$
KB|=Q
$$
If $KB$ is a knowledge base, then the sentence above mean that whenever all statements in $KB$ are true, $Q$ is also true.
# Derivation
Derivation is a process by which a sentence is derived from a knowledge base:
$$
KB|-Q
$$
This means that $Q$ can be derived using some steps from knowledge base $KB$
