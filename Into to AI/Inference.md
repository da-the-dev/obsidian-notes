Is a process of making conclusion from a known knowledge base.
Inference can be of 2 types: [[Entailment and derivation|entailment and derivation]]

# Properties of inference
## Soundness
If $KB|-Q$ then $KB|=Q$
If $Q$ can be derived from $KB$, then $Q$ is entailed by $KB$
***Soundness* means that only true statements can be proven using inference rules**

## Completeness
If $KB|=Q$ then $KB|-Q$
If $Q$ is entailed by $KB$, then $Q$ can be derived by $KB$
***Completeness* means that we can prove everything that is true**
