The idea of logic programming is to use rules, knowledge bases to let the computer figure out how to achieve the result with facts and logic

# Imperative vs Logic programming
Imperative
- Statements
- Code and Data
- Code by programmer
- Data as input from programmer/user
- Actions from User (sometimes)
- Program build from libraries but many of the units are special purpose
Logic
- Rules
- Inference Engine/Knowledge Base
- Inference Engine built in
- Knowledge base by programmer/user
- Queries from User
- Rapid deployment and prototyping as the language has the inference engine by default
# Prolog
Prolog is a general-purpose logic programming language associated
with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.
Prolog stands for **Pro**gramming in **Lo**gic.
