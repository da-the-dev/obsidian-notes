- [[Perceptron|Single layer]] can only deal with linearly separable problems
- To deal with multiple dimensions the network needs to expand in the number of layers
	- Increases the dimensionality; everything in a high dimensional space BECOMES linearly separable
- As this expands larger and larger the type of problems which can be faced expands
	- [[Deep learning]]
	- Beware of Overtraining
