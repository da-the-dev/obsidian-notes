If we are going to say that a given program thinks like a human, we must have some way of
determining how humans think. 
There are three ways to do this: 
- Introspection — trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by
- Psychological experiments — observing a person in action; and through
- Brain imaging — observing the brain in action.

The interdisciplinary field of **cognitive science** brings together computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to construct precise and testable theories of the human mind.
