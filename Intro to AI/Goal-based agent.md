A goal-based agent is similar to [[Model-based reflex agent]] and [[Simple reflex agent]], since they both rely on some [[Simple reflex agent#Condition action rule|condition action rules]] and must have a mental model of the world. 

However, goal-based agent must also consider the future consequences of their actions. Simple reflex agents blindly follow condition action rules, but goal-based agent choose what action to do on their own.
