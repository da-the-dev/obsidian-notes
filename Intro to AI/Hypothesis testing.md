# Types of hypotheses
## Alternative hypothesis
This is the hypothesis that you propose, also known as the alternative hypothesis $H_{A}$. For example:
- $H_{A}$: There is a relationship between intelligence and academic results.
- $H_{A}$: First year university students obtain higher grades after an intensive Statistics course.
- $H_{A}$: Males and females differ in their levels of stress.
## Null hypothesis
This is the opposite of the alternative hypothesis and expresses that there is no relationship between variables:
- $H_{O}$: There is no relationship between intelligence and academic results.
- $H_{O}$:  First year university students do not obtain higher grades after an intensive Statistics course.
- $H_{O}$: Males and females will not differ in their levels of stress.
# Testing
The hypothesis testing process can be divided into five steps:
1. Restate the research question as research hypothesis and a null hypothesis about the populations.
2. Determine the characteristics of the comparison distribution.
3. Determine the cut off sample score on the comparison distribution at which the null hypothesis should be rejected.
4. Determine your sample’s score on the comparison distribution.
5. Decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
