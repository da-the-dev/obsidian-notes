Developed by Isaac Asimov:
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm *(LAW ONE – DO NO HARM)*
2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. *(LAW TWO – OBEY HUMANS)*
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. *(LAW THREE – SELF PRESERVATION)*
