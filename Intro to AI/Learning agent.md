Unlike regular agents, this [[IU Notes/Intro to AI/Agent|agent]] does not come with a given agent program. It develops one for itself.
A learning agent consists of 4 parts:
- Learning element - uses feedback from the critic to make effective adjustments
- Performance element - entity that selects external actions to use. Sometimes it is a whole agent.
- Critic - an observing element that gives feedback to the learning element and sometimes changes the performance element to correct mistakes.
- Problem generator - generates suggests actions to the learning elements for evaluation.
