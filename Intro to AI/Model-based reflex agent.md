An [[IU Notes/Intro to AI/Agent|agent]] that maintains a model of the world as its internal state.

# Model
The model consists of:
- How the world evolves independently of the agent
- How the agent affects the world

This model helps the agent to understand "how the world works", since it track its state.

As one can see, this type of agent also involves parts of the [[Simple reflex agent]]
