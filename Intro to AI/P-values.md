Imagine a drug study. Drug A and B are tested on a large population. Some people get cured by A or B, some are not cured. We need to know is there any difference between drug A and drug B
> If p-value between drug A and drug B is less than 0.05, this means that there's no difference between them, and if we did testing again the same number of times, then only 5% of those experiments would result in a **wrong decision**

p-values help us decide whether we should reject the [[Hypothesis testing#Null hypothesis|Null hypothesis]] or not during [[Hypothesis testing]]
# Lecture definition
Often we will want to figure the probability of making a [[Types of errors#Type I|Type I]] error exactly! The test is only ensuring it is meeting with set [[confidence]]. For this we compute a P-value of the test
We say that tests which have a:
- P-value $< 0.05$ are "statistically significant" $\to \alpha > .95 \text{ or } 95\%$ [[confidence]]
- P-value $< 0.01$ are "extremely (very) statistically significant" $\to \alpha > .99 \text{ or } 99\%$ [[confidence]]
