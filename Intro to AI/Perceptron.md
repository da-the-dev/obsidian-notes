The simplest form of an [[Artificial Neural Networks|artificial neural network]]. A single layer feed forward skinny boi:
$$
output = step_{0}\left( \sum w_{i}x_{i} \right),\text{ where } step_{0}(m)=1 \text{ if } m>0 \text{ and } 0 \text{ otherwise}
$$

You can see:
- Inputs
- Weights
- Weighted sum is $all\ inputs \times all\ weights$
- A step function (also known as [[activation function]])
