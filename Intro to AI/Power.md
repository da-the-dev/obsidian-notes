A measure of the acceptance of [[Types of errors#Type II|Type II]] errors:
- Failing to reject the [[Hypothesis testing#Null hypothesis|Null hypothesis]] when in reality we should have rejected
- Saying two things are the same when in fact they are different
- Acquitting an guilty man!
- Saying someone does not have HIV when in reality they do!
- **False Negative**
**Power** is measured by the $\beta - value$ with most scientific measures ignoring it. The majority of statistical tests do not control for this, though increasing the sample size increases power.
