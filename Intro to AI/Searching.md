>*In which we see how an agent can find a sequence of actions that achieves its goals when no single action will do.*

We can solve problems by searching for solutions *(learn)* using different searching algorithms 
# Types of searches
## Uninformed search
- Have no sence of the problem domain
- Only has problem definition
- Is able to solve any problem, though, inefficiently
## Informed search
- Use a heuristic function developed for the domain
- Applicable in their own domain

# Necessary elements
## Goal formulation
For a problem solving agent to complete its mission it must understand its goal
## Problem formulation
This is a process of deciding what actions and states to consider, given a goal.
## Search
Given a goal and a problem, the [[goal-based agent]] now searches for a solution
# Execution
Once the solution is found, the agent completes it's assignment
