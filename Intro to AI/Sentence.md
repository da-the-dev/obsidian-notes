Sentence in some statement that describes a [[Model|model]]. 
# Example
$x + y = 4$
$y + x^{2} = 24$

These statements put constraints on the model and limit the amount of values that can be put in a model. 
If *sentence* $\alpha$ is true in *model* $m$, then we say that **$m$ satisfies $\alpha$** or **$m$ is a model of $\alpha$**
# Types of sentences
## Satisfiable 
If it is true under some interpretation
## Valid
If it is true under all possible interpretations
## Inconsistent
If it is false no matter the interpretation
