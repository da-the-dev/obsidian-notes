[[Goal-based agent]] only considers paths to achieve some goal. It does not look for, for example, the most efficient approach. Utility-based agents consider how "happy" or "unhappy" the approach is. Scientific term for "happy" or "unhappy" is **utility**.
If some approaches satisfy internal utility function and the external performance measure, **utility function** computes effectiveness of a given approach.
