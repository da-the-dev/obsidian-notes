# Coefficient of determination ($R^{2}$)
It measures how well a statistical model predicts an outcome. The outcome is represented by the model’s dependent variable.

The lowest possible value of $R^{2}$ is 0 and the highest possible value is 1. Put simply, the better a model is at making predictions, the closer its R² will be to 1.
$$
R^2 = 1 - (RSS/TSS)
$$

where $RSS$ = sum of squared residuals and $TSS$ = total sum of squares
