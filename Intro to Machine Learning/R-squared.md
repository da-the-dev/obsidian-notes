# Coefficient of determination ($R^{2}$)
It measures how well a statistical model predicts an outcome. The outcome is represented by the model’s dependent variable.

The lowest possible value of $R^{2}$ is 0 and the highest possible value is 1. Put simply, the better a model is at making predictions, the closer its R² will be to 1.
$$
R^2 = \dfrac{Var(mean) - Var(func)}{Var(mean)}
$$
where:
- $Var(mean)$ is the variation around the mean
- $Var(func)$ is the variation around the function
