Basically all computer hardware communicates over some data bus
[[CPU]], [[IO]], [[Memory]]

# Types of buses
## Parallel bus
- Used for short distances.
- Transfers multiple bits at the same time.
- Faster than serial bus.
- More expensive and complex.
- Requires more wires/fibers.
- Widely used within integrated circuits.
- Commonly used in earlier system buses.
## Serial bus
- Used for long distances.
- Transfers one bit at a time.
- Slower than parallel bus.
- Cheaper and simpler.
- Requires fewer interconnecting cables.
- Many ICs have serial interfaces, as opposed to parallel ones, so they have fewer pins and are therefore less expensive.
- Prevalent in modern computers.

# Examples
- Double Data Rate connects [[CPU]] and [[Memory|RAM]]
- PCI - a bus for external devices (audio cards, [[GPU|GPUs]])
- USB
