A fundamental theorem for solving and understanding [[LPP]]. It states:
> Given a linear program in standard form where $\textbf{A}$ is an $m \times n$ matrix of rank $m$,
>  1. if there is a feasible solution, there is a [[Types of solutions|basic feasible solution]] , 
>  2. if there is an optimal feasible solution, there is an optimal basic feasible solution.
