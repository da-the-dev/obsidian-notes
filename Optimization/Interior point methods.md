Interior point methods are a selection of optimization methods for [[NLP]]s. They all approach the solution differently, however, they all share these 3 consepts:
1. Shoot through the interior of the feasible region toward an optimal solution.
2. Move in a direction that improves the objective function value at the fastest possible rate.
3. Transform the feasible region to place the current trial solution near its center, thereby enabling a large improvement when concept 2 is implemented.
