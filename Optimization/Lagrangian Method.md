In [[Jacobian method]], let 
$$
\lambda = \dfrac{ \partial f }{ \partial \textbf{g} }=\nabla_{\textbf{Y}_{0}}fJ^{-1}
$$
Let:
$$
L(\textbf{X}, \lambda) = f(\textbf{X}) - \lambda \textbf{g}(\textbf{X})
$$
The function $L$ is called the *Lagrangian function* and the elements of the vector $L$ constitute the *Lagrange multipliers*. By definition, these multipliers have the same interpretation as the sensitivity coefficients of the [[Jacobian method]]
Now take partial derivative for all $x$ and all $\lambda$ and make these partial derivatives equal to zero.
