# How-to
## Install
- Clone the repo, open it in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- Allow trust authors and enable plugins.
- You call update the contents of the vault with the latest changes by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`
## Usage
- *Idea* – Subjects are broken down into atomic ideas that are represented as notes, which later can be linked with each other like Wikipedia references, or like the WWW. Main advantage over taking notes in sequence (one lecture after the other) is that it's easy to add new info to old topics
- There are **Exam lists** – files that compile topics to a certain exam. To find them hit `Ctrl+O` – the **Quick Switcher** – and type the exam type and the subject. You'll find the note you need. 
- You can use the **Quick Switcher** in the same fashion to find notes on topics. If all else fails, `Ctrl+Shift+F` to directly search for content.
- Check out graph view with `Ctrl+G`. You'll see how different topics connect
- Use standard browser navigation (`Ctrl+T` to open new tabs, for example)
- For a given note, open backlinks and outgoing links (use `Ctrl+P` and look up "link") to jump to connected notes. 
	- Backlinks – mentions of current note in other notes *(from current to other)*
	- Outgoing links – mentions of other notes in current note *(from other to current)*
## Contribution
You can contribute your notes and expand this repo into a gigachad knowledge database. You can provide pull requests with changes, or by opening up issues.

**For IU students**: there's and ongoing issue [#3](https://github.com/da-the-dev/obsidian-notes/issues/3) that asks to make topic lists for exams. This would simplify navigation. I would appreciate any help with this. You can refer to [[Exam Lists ToDo]] to find what lists are completed and which are still in progress
