# How to navigate
- Subjects are broken down into atomic ideas that are represented as notes, which later can be linked with each other like Wikipedia references, or like the WWW. Main advantage over taking notes in sequence (one lecture after the other) is that it's easy to add new info to old topics
- You can contribute your notes and expand this repo into a gigachad knowledge database.
## Navigate
- *Idea* – Subjects are broken down into atomic ideas that are represented as notes, which later can be linked with each other like Wikipedia references, or like the WWW. Main advantage over taking notes in sequence (one lecture after the other) is that it's easy to add new info to old topics
- There are **Exam lists** – files that compile topics to a certain exam. To find them either:
	- hit `Ctrl-O` – **the Quick Switcher** – and type the exam type and the subject. You'll find the note you need. 
	- or hit `Ctrl+P` to open up the **Command Panel** *(like in VSCode)*, then type "show tags". Hit `Enter`, then `Cltr+Click` the `examlist` tag and the tag for your subject. You'll find exam lists in the left menu.
- You can use the Quick Switcher in the same fashion to find notes on topics. If all else fails, `Ctrl+Shift+f` to directly search for content.
## Contribution
You can contribute your notes and expand this repo into a gigachad knowledge database. You can provide pull requests with changes, or by opening up issues.

**For IU students**: there's and ongoing issue #2 that asks to make topic lists for exams. This would simplify navigation. I would appreciate any help with this.
