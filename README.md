# How to
- Clone the repo, open it in Obsidian.
- Allow trust authors and enable plugins.
- You call update the contents of the vault with the latest changes by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+p`
# How to navigate
- Subjects are broken down into atomic ideas that are represented as notes, which later can be linked with each other like Wikipedia references, or like the WWW. Main advantage over taking notes in sequence (one lecture after the other) is that it's easy to add new info to old topics
- You can contribute your notes and expand this repo into a gigachad knowledge database.
# Contribution
- If you feel like it, you can provide pull requests with changes.
- **For IU students**: there's and ongoing issue [#3](https://github.com/da-the-dev/obsidian-notes/issues/3) that asks to make topic lists for exams. This would simplify navigation. I would appreciate any help with this.
