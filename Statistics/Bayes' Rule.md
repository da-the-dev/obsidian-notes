$A$ - given hypothesis. $P(H_{i})$ - the [[Probability|probability]] of an event. Formula to find the probability of the hypothesis being fulfilled:
$$
P(A) = \sum^n_{i = 1}P(H_{i}) \times P(A |H_{i})
$$
where $n$ - amount of events,  $P(A|H_{i})$ - probability of the hypothesis to be fulfilled given the event $P(H_{i})$
# Bayesâ€™ rule:
$$
P(H_{i}|A)=\dfrac{P(H_{i}) \times P(A|H_{i})} {P(A)}
$$
Calculates the probability that the hypothesis $A$ was fulled when the condition $H_{i}$ is met. The probability of an event $H_{i}$ can be calculated by formula (however, usually this probability is already given in the condition)
$$
P(A|H_{i}) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(H_{i})}
$$
