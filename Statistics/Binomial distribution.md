A [[Probability distribution]] that has only two outcomes: Success and Failure
# Rules (Bernoulli process)
1. Must have fixed number of trials
2. Trials must be independent
3. Every trial must be either a success or a failure
4. The probability of success remains the same in all trials
# Random variable
[[Random variable]] $X$ describes the number of successes.
# Vocab
$n$ - number of trials
$q$ - [[probability]] of failing
$p$ - [[probability]] of getting "x" successes

# Binomial probability formula
$$
b(x;n,p)_{X} = \dfrac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}\  p^x\  q^{n-x}\ \ \ \ x=0,1,2,\dots,n.
$$

Same as combination formula, but with funky stuff.

# Mean
[[Mean]] for binomial distribution is
$$
\mu=np
$$
# Variance
[[Variance]] for binomial distribution is
$$
\sigma^{2}=npq
$$
