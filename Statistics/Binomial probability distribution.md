A [[Probability distribution|probability distribution]] that has only two outcome: Success and Failure
# Rules
1. Must have fixed number of trials
2. Trials must be independent
3. Every trial must be either a success or a failure
4. The probability of success remains the same in all trials
# Vocab
$n$ - number of trials
$p$ - probability of success in a single trial
$q$ - probability of failing
$x$ - number of success that occur in $n$ trials
$P(x)$ - probability of getting "x" successes

# Binomial probability formula
$$
P(x) = \dfrac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}\  P^x\  q^{n-x}
$$
Same as combination formula, but with funky stuff.
