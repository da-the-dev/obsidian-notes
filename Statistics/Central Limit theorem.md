If $\bar{X}$ is the mean of the random [[Vocab#^efd78b|sample]] of size $n$ taken from a population with mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^{2}$, then the limiting form of the distribution of
$$
Z = \dfrac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{ n }}
$$
as $n\to \infty$, is the standard normal distribution $n(z;0,1)$
