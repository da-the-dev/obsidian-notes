One of the simplest [[Probability distribution|continuous distributions]]. This distribution is characterized by a density function that is "flat", and thus the probability is uniform in a closed interval.
$$
f(x; A, B) = \begin{cases}
\dfrac{1}{B-A}, & A \leq x \leq B \\
0, & elsewhere.
\end{cases}
$$
# Mean
The [[mean]]:
$$
\mu = \dfrac{A+B}{2}
$$
# Variance
The variance:
$$
\sigma^{2} = \dfrac{(B-A)^{2}}{12}
$$
