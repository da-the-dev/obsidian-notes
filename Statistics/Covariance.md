Covariance shows the dynamic between two variables in the same [[Joint probability]], how they [[Variance|vary]]. 
$$
Cov(X,Y) = E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])]
$$

For *discrete distributions*:
$$
Cov(X,Y)=\dfrac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=1}(x_{i}-E(X))(y_{i}-E(Y))
$$
 where:
- $n$ is the number of values in a dataset
- $E(A)$ is an [[Expected value|expected value]] for [[Probability distribution#Random variable|random variable]] $A$.
