A cumulative distribution function (CDF) is a function that describes the [[probability]] that a [[random variable]] takes on a value less than or equal to a given value. For a continuous [[random variable]], the CDF is the integral of the [[Probability distribution|probability density function]] from negative infinity up to the value of $x$:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{x} f(x) \, dx = c(x)
$$
