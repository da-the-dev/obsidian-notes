 # Definition 
[[Vocab#^a5bf63|Data]] - any observations that have been collected
**Data** must be **[[Randomness|random]]** to avoid **bias**.
Data can be ordered into [[Frequency distribution|frequency distributions]].
# Two types of data
## Qualitative (or categorical)
Data that is not numeric (color, gender, religion, race, **zip code**, etc.)
Mathematical operation on such data **makes no sense**.
## Quantitative
Data that is numerical (age, height, weight, wages, temperature etc.)
Math operations are **meaningful**.
### Types of quantitative  data
#### Discrete
Data that is countable or finite (eggs, dice, etc.)
#### Continuous
Data cannot be counted and is infinite (height, length, etc.)
# Characteristics
## Center
Center is "the middle" of the dataset.
### Types
#### Mean
Arithmetical average.
It *is* affected by [[Outliers|outliers]].

$\Sigma$ - a sum
$x$ - value of data
$n$ - # of items in a [[Vocab#^efd78b|sample]].
$N$ - # of items in a [[Vocab#^bcc47c|population]].
$\bar{X}$ - sample mean. $\bar{X}=\dfrac{\Sigma x}{n}$
$\mu$ - population mean. $\mu = \dfrac{\Sigma x}{N}$


#### Median
A true middle of a dataset.
*Data must be in order*
It *is not* affected by outliers

Find the middle value:
- Odd number of values:
	- Median is the middle value:
	- 1 2 3 **4** 5 6 7
- Even number of values:
	- Take the mean of two middle values:
	- 1 2 **3 4** 5 6. Median is $\dfrac{3+4}{2}=3.5$
## Variation
How the data is spread apart. 

**Ways to measure variation:**
### Range
$max - min=range$
Pros:
- Easy to find
Cons:
- Doesn't take into account all values

## Distribution
## Outliers
## Changes over time
