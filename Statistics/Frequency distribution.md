A list of values and corresponding frequencies. Similar to [[Probability distribution]].
These can be plotted with [[Histogram|histograms]].
# Class width
Difference between two "lower class limits". *Must be a whole number. If not, round **up***.
## Lower class limit
Smallest number belonging to a class.
## Upper class limit
Largest value belonging to a class.
## Class midpoint
$\dfrac{upper+lower}{2}$
## Class boundaries
Used to separate classes without gaps
# Steps to a FD
- Determine # of classes
- Figure out the class width
	- $CW = \dfrac{max - min}{\#classes}$
	- Ex: min = 18, max = 18, 8 classes. Class width = 3.25, **4**
- Start with the smallest value
- Create classes with class width
- Fill in the number of samples that fit a class
# Types of distributions
## Regular
Show how much samples fall into a class.
## Relative
$\dfrac{Class\ frec}{n}$
Shows what portion of all samples fall into a class.
## Cumulative
$C_{i} = v_{i} + C_{i-1}$
Adds sequential classes together.

We can calculate an average grade even if we haven't done all test. Cool!
