A special case of [[Negative binomial distribution]]. If we consider $k=1$, then we have a probability distribution for a number of trials to obtain a single success.

# Example 
Distribution to get the first head on the $x$'th coin toss:
$$
b^{\star}(x;1,p) = pq^{x-1}
$$
So for the 4th coin toss we get:
$$
b^{\star}(4;1,\dfrac{1}{2})=\dfrac{1}{2}\times (\dfrac{1}{2})^{3}=\dfrac{1}{16}
$$
Since $k=1$, the formula's signature is reduced to $g(x;p)$.

# Mean
[[Mean]] of a geometric distribution:
$$
\mu = \dfrac{1}{p}
$$
# Variance
[[Variance]] of a geometric distribution:
$$
\sigma^{2}=\dfrac{1-p}{p^{2}}
