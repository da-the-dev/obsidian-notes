Natural zero - if one has zero of something, that means they **have none of** that qualitative category.
# Four levels of measurement
## Nominal
Categories **are not ordered** (religion, gender, etc.). Similar to [[Data|qualitative data]]
## Ordinal
Categories **are ordered**, however **differences are meaningless** (Eg. drivers in a race. Numbers cannot be subtracted to get new information, since everything can be derived from order)
## Interval
Categories **are ordered**, **differences are meaningful**, but a **natural zero does not exist** (temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit, charge)
## Ratio
Categories **are ordered**, **differences are meaningful**, **natural zero exists** (money in a bank account)
