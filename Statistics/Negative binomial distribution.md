A [[Binomial distribution]], but the experiment is repeated until a *fixed number of successes* occur. We are looking to land on a success after $k$'th success after $x$ trials.
# Random variable
[[Random variable]] $X$ of this distribution is a number of trials to get $k$ successes.
# Formula
$$
b^{\star}(x;k,p) = {x-1 \choose k-1}p^{k}q^{x-k}
$$
