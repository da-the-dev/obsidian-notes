The "bell curve" distribution
![[Pasted image 20231201195220.png|500]]
This distribution's formula assumes given [[mean]] and [[variance]]:
$$
n(x; \mu, \sigma) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{ 2\pi }\sigma}e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}(x-\mu)^{2}}, -\infty<x<\infty
$$
A [[random variable]] that has a bell curve as the distribution is called a **normal random variable**.
