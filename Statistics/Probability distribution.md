# Random variable
A variable, x, that has a value for each outcome of a procedure that is determined by chance.

Random variables can be [[Data#Continuous|discrete]] and [[Data#Continuous|continuous]].
# Standard deviation
How much each data point varies from the closest data points
$\sigma = \sqrt{ \Sigma[x^{2}*P(x)] - \mu^{2} }$
# Usual vs unusual
Values are <u>unusual</u> if the lie outside of $[\mu - 2\sigma, \mu+2\sigma]$
