Chance that any given event occurs
# Types of probabilities
## Observed
Probability that is estimated based on observations
$$
P(A) = \dfrac{\#times\ A\ occured}{\#times\ procedure\ executed}
$$
## Classical
Probability based on the chance of an event occurring
$$
P(A) = \dfrac{\#\ ways\ A\ could\ occur}{\#\ simple\ events}
$$
## Subjective
Some estimate based on a guess.

# Complementary events
Events that cannot happen at the same time (mutually exclusive)
