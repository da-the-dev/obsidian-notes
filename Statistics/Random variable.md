A random variable $X$ is a function that associates a real number with each element
in the [[Probability space|sample space]].
# Difference between X and x in f(x)
The $X$ is a random variable. It is the thing that changes values, iterates over every value in the the sample space. The $x$ in $f(x)$ is a "constant" variable. Random variable $X$ takes on a value, and for each $X$ exists some value $f(X=x)$ that describes the probability of $X$ occuring.
# Example
In the case of tossing a coin three times, the variable $X$, representing the number of heads, assumes value 2 with probability $\dfrac{3}{8}$, since 3 of the 8 equally likely sample points result in two heads and one tail (only 3 out of 8 possibilities have 2 heads and 1 tail).
