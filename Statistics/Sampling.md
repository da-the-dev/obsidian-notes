# Common sampling techniques
Used to achieve a [[Randomness#Simple random sample|simple random sample]].
## Convenience sampling
**!!!Not random!!!** 
Members of a population are selected by convenience (close friends in a group, etc.)
## Systematic sampling
Put population in order and select every $k$'th member.
## Stratified sampling
Break a population into subgroups based on some characteristic and take some members from each subgroup.
## Cluster sampling
Break a population into subgroups (clusters) randomly (no characteristic is used) and randomly selected a number of clusters (like systematic sampling, but with clusters).
