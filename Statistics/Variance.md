How much each data point varies from the mean. Describes the [[Probability density function]]
# Continuous case
$$
Var(x) = E(x^2) - (E(x))^2
$$
where $E(x)$ is the [[Expected value]]. 
Can be rewritten into
$$

$$
# Discrete case
$$
\sigma^{2}=\Sigma[x^{2}*P(x)] - \mu^{2}
$$
where $\mu$ is the [[Expected value#Discrete case|mean]] for a discrete case
